Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up your project from installing MongoDB for VS Code extension to connecting VS Code with MongoDB Compass, along with installing necessary requirements and configuring VS Code for C++ development:

# 1. Install MongoDB for VS Code Extension:
   - Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for "MongoDB for VS Code" in the Extensions Marketplace.
   - Click on "Install" to install the extension.

# 2. Install MongoDB Compass:
   - Download MongoDB Compass from the official MongoDB website: [MongoDB Compass Download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)
   - Follow the installation instructions provided for your operating system.
   - Once installed, open MongoDB Compass.

# 3. Install MongoDB Server:
   - Download MongoDB Community Edition from the official MongoDB website: [MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
   - Follow the installation instructions provided for your operating system.
   - During installation, make sure to select the options to install MongoDB as a service and specify the data directory.

# 4. Start MongoDB Server:
   - After installation, open a command prompt or terminal.
   - Run the `mongod` command to start the MongoDB server. Make sure to run it with administrative privileges if necessary.
   - You should see log messages indicating that the server has started successfully.

# 5. Connect VS Code with MongoDB Compass:
   - In VS Code, open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
   - Type "MongoDB: Connect" and select the option to connect to a MongoDB instance.
   - Enter the connection string for your MongoDB server. This typically looks like `mongodb://localhost:27017`.
   - Once connected, you should see your MongoDB databases and collections in the MongoDB Explorer view in VS Code.

# 6. Install Requirements for your Project:
   - Identify the dependencies required for your project.
   - Use a package manager like npm (for Node.js projects), pip (for Python projects), or any other relevant package manager to install the required dependencies.

# 7. Install C++ Development Tools in VS Code:
   - Open VS Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for "C++" in the Extensions Marketplace.
   - Install the "C/C++" extension provided by Microsoft.
   - Once installed, you may need to configure the extension according to your project's requirements.

# 8. Configure VS Code for C++ Development:
   - Open your C++ project folder in VS Code.
   - Create or open your C++ source files.
   - Configure build tasks, debug configurations, and other settings as needed for your specific project requirements.

# By following these steps, you should have MongoDB set up for development in VS Code, along with the necessary tools and configurations for C++ development.
